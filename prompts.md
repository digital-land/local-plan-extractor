# Prompts and Implementation Steps

This document tracks all user requests and the implementation steps taken to fulfill them.

## Session Context

This session continued from a previous conversation that had implemented:
- Adding `local-planning-authorities` field to JSON output
- Creating HTML rendering system using GOV.UK Frontend and Jinja2
- Building complete site with homepage, local plan pages, and organisation pages
- Adding interactive Leaflet maps showing planning authority boundaries

## 1. Fix GitHub Pages 404 Error for GeoJSON Files

**User Prompt:**
> "the maps are unable to load the geojson https://digital-land.github.io/local-plan-extractor/var/cache/local-planning-authority.geojson returns 404"

**Problem Identified:**
- The `.gitignore` file had `var/` which was preventing `docs/var/` from being committed
- GeoJSON and CSV data files needed for maps were not in the repository

**Steps Taken:**

1. **Updated `.gitignore`** (line 13)
   - Changed `var/` to `/var/` to only ignore the root `var/` directory
   - This allows `docs/var/` to be committed

2. **Committed data files**
   - Added `docs/var/cache/local-planning-authority.geojson` (44MB)
   - Added `docs/var/cache/organisation.csv`
   - Added other cache files needed by the site

3. **Result:** Maps now load correctly on GitHub Pages

**Commit:** `8df3c8a` - "Add docs/var/cache data files for GitHub Pages deployment"

## 2. Move Housing Numbers to Array for Single Authority Plans

**User Prompt:**
> "in the case of a single (not a joint) local plan, also move the -housing numbers fields to the housing-numbers array"

**Problem:**
- Joint plans had housing data in `housing-numbers` array
- Single authority plans had housing data at top level
- Inconsistent data structure between plan types

**Steps Taken:**

1. **Created utility script** `bin/move_housing_to_array.py`
   - Scans all JSON files for top-level housing fields
   - Moves fields into `housing-numbers` array
   - Preserves organisation information and notes

2. **Updated 3 JSON files:**
   - `gloucester-city-plan-low-res.json`
   - `1_Core_Strategy_ldf.json`
   - `Cheltenham_Plan.json`

3. **Modified extractor** `bin/local-plan-extractor.py` (lines 414-419)
   - Added code to remove top-level housing fields after copying to array
   - Ensures future extractions use consistent structure

4. **Regenerated HTML pages** to reflect updated structure

**Result:** All plans now have housing data in `housing-numbers` array

**Commit:** `40f3cdc` - "Move housing numbers to array for single authority plans"

## 3. Update Extractor to Always Populate Housing-Numbers Array

**User Prompt:**
> "change the local-plan-extractor.py script to also put the housing numbers into the housing-numbers array"

**Problem:**
- The Claude API prompt instructed to only use `housing-numbers` array for joint plans
- Manual code was copying top-level fields to array after extraction
- This was inefficient and error-prone

**Steps Taken:**

1. **Updated Claude API prompt** (lines 182-251)
   - Changed instructions to ALWAYS populate `housing-numbers` array
   - For single authority plans: create ONE entry in the array
   - For joint plans: create one entry per member authority
   - Removed references to top-level housing fields

2. **Simplified processing logic** (lines 334-407)
   - Removed manual array creation code for single authority plans
   - Changed joint plan detection: check if `housing-numbers` has > 1 entry
   - For single plans: copy organisation code from array entry to top level

3. **Updated display output** (lines 489-533)
   - Modified to read from array for both single and joint plans
   - Single plans: display the one entry as a summary
   - Joint plans: display all entries as a breakdown

**Result:** Claude API directly populates the array structure, eliminating post-processing

**Commit:** `0ceec3d` - "Update extractor to always populate housing-numbers array"

## 4. Make HTML Links Relative for Local Testing

**User Prompt:**
> "Make all the HTML links relative URLs so it works when testing locally as well as when it's deployed to GitHub pages"

**Problem:**
- Templates used absolute URLs starting with `/`
- Site only worked when deployed to GitHub Pages
- Couldn't test locally using `file://` protocol

**Steps Taken:**

1. **Updated template files:**
   - **base.html** (line 54): Changed header logo from `/` to `{{ home_path | default('index.html') }}`
   - **local-plan.html** (line 9): Changed breadcrumb from `/` to `../index.html`
   - **organisation.html** (line 9): Changed breadcrumb from `/` to `../../index.html`

2. **Updated render script** `bin/render.py`:
   - Pass `home_path='index.html'` to index template (line 151)
   - Pass `home_path='../index.html'` to local plan templates (line 101)
   - Pass `home_path='../../index.html'` to organisation templates (line 129)

3. **URL structure created:**
   - From `docs/index.html`: links to `index.html`
   - From `docs/local-plan/*.html`: links to `../index.html`
   - From `docs/organisation/*/index.html`: links to `../../index.html`

4. **Regenerated all 51 HTML files** with relative URLs

**Result:** Site works both locally (`file://`) and on GitHub Pages

**Commit:** `b758d58` - "Use relative URLs in all HTML pages for local testing"

## 5. Use Commas in Joint Organisation Names

**User Prompt:**
> "when constructing the organisation name for a joint local plan, use commas to separate each member organisation rather than \" and \""

**Problem:**
- Joint plan organisation names used " and " as separator
- Example: "Bolton Council and Bury Council and Manchester Council..."
- Less readable, especially for plans with many authorities

**Steps Taken:**

1. **Updated extractor prompt** `bin/local-plan-extractor.py` (lines 185, 225)
   - Changed: `"list all authorities separated by \" and \""`
   - To: `"list all authorities separated by commas"`
   - Updated example: `"Babergh District Council, Mid Suffolk District Council"`

2. **Created utility script** `bin/fix_organisation_names.py`
   - Scans JSON files for organisation names containing " and "
   - Replaces " and " with ", "
   - Reports changes made

3. **Updated 3 JSON files:**
   - `places-for-everyone-joint-development-plan-dec24.json`
   - `core-strategy-12-final.json`
   - `babergh-and-mid-suffolk-joint-local-plan-part-1-nov-2023.json`

4. **Example change:**
   - Before: "Bolton Metropolitan Borough Council and Bury Metropolitan Borough Council and Manchester City Council..."
   - After: "Bolton Metropolitan Borough Council, Bury Metropolitan Borough Council, Manchester City Council..."

5. **Regenerated HTML pages** to display updated format

**Result:** Much more readable organisation names for joint plans

**Commit:** `cb1d7dd` - "Use commas to separate organisations in joint plan names"

---

## 6. Fix Joint Organisation Names in Housing-Numbers Breakdown

**User Prompt:**
> "use the same joint organisation name in the housing-numbers breakdown"

**Problem:**
- Top-level `organisation-name` field was updated to use commas
- Joint authority entry in `housing-numbers` array still used " and "
- Inconsistent formatting between top-level and array entry

**Steps Taken:**

1. **Extended utility script** `bin/fix_organisation_names.py`
   - Added logic to check `housing-numbers` array entries
   - Specifically targets joint authority entries (where `organisation` starts with `joint-planning-authority:`)
   - Updates both top-level and array entries
   - Provides detailed reporting of changes

2. **Updated same 3 JSON files:**
   - Fixed joint authority entries in `housing-numbers` arrays
   - Ensured consistency between top-level and array entry

3. **Verification:**
   - Top-level `organisation-name`: uses commas ✓
   - Joint entry `organisation-name`: uses commas ✓
   - Both fields now match exactly ✓

4. **Regenerated HTML pages** with consistent formatting

**Result:** Complete consistency in organisation name formatting throughout JSON structure

**Commit:** `d22071b` - "Fix joint organisation names in housing-numbers breakdown"

## Technical Decisions

### Why commas instead of "and"?
- More readable for long lists (e.g., 9 councils in Places for Everyone)
- Standard list formatting convention
- Easier to parse programmatically
- Matches common data formatting practices

### Why housing-numbers array for all plans?
- Consistent data structure between single and joint plans
- Easier to process programmatically
- Allows for future extensions (e.g., multiple housing scenarios)
- Cleaner JSON structure without top-level duplication

### Why relative URLs?
- Enables local testing without running a web server
- Works regardless of deployment path
- More robust and portable
- Standard web development practice

### Why modify the Claude prompt instead of post-processing?
- More efficient - correct structure from the start
- Reduces code complexity
- Fewer places where bugs can occur
- Claude API understands the requirement directly
