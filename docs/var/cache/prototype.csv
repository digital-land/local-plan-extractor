• Years 11 to 17 (2033 to 2040): 545dpa.

The exact housing requirement will be confirmed as part of the Regulation 19 publication draft, expected in Autumn 2025, and will be based on updated evidence including the Housing and Economic Land Availability Assessment (HELAA) and Strategic Housing Market Assessment (SHMA). The formula for calculating Standard Method was revised to help achieve Government’s stretch target of 1.5m new homes over 5 years. The new formula has increased the calculation to a cumulative delivery of 27,111 over the 20 year lifespan of the Local Plan (2023-2043), or an average rate of 1,291 homes per year.

Much of the Local Plan, including the site allocations policies, remains unchanged.

The most significant changes are a result of a reduction in the assessment of housing need, with the updated plan reducing the number of houses required to be built in the Borough to 305 homes per year instead of the previous 415. 

The shortfall in Wyre, established through the Wyre Local Plan (2011-2031) is provided for through the new housing requirement of 305 dwellings per annum for the period 2019-2032 in the Partial Review of the Fylde Local Plan to 2032.

a) Hart’s objectively assessed housing need (OAHN) of 382 homes per annum identified in the Joint Strategic Housing Market Area Assessment for Hart, Rushmoor and Surrey Heath November 2016 (SHMA); plus 

b) An additional 41 homes per annum (731 homes) to address an unmet housing need in Surrey Heath under the duty to cooperate. Surrey Heath is part of the Hart, Rushmoor/Surrey Heath Housing Market Area. In June
2018 Surrey Heath Borough Council published a Draft

on which sites will be approved. The LP allocates sites which when considered alongside the assumed
contributions from small unidentified sites will ensure an adequate delivery. In order to do so it is necessary
to identify land able to deliver 329 dwellings per year over the life of the LP (2021-2041). To ensure this
level of delivery land with a greater capacity must be identified to allow for some sites not coming forward.
Just as the outgoing Local Plan identified some sites not expected to be completed within its plan period,
so the new LP and its reviews will need to address continuity by making some provision for development
which could occur after 2041. While the LP is almost certain to be reviewed before its end date, it is
considered good practice to provide allocations that meet the entire needs as they are currently identified
up to 2041 in this version of the LP.","https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/local-plans/images/a9f5d794-f82d-48c8-8d34-7ea80f4b9b0c/5c1c05cc-63a7-47cc-a203-ac4ac4ac6446.jpg","2020-09-23 09:14:49.506102","2025-05-21 01:34:49.004130","","","","",""

The review rolls the Plan forward to 2039. The housing numbers (545/pa) still allow for growth (its own housing need based on standard method plus a growth uplift) but differs from adopted plan is that the review does not include provision for meeting some need from other Warwickshire authorities, principally Coventry. Coventry made representations and appeared at the examination to say that it wanted and expected to, meet its housing needs in its own area now.

Option A: Continue with same level of annual housing growth beyond 2033.   This method would see the continuation of providing 325 homes per year as set out within the existing local plan.
Option B: Use the updated national standard methodology for calculating local housing need. The National Planning Policy Framework currently expects local planning authorities to use the standard method to identify the
minimum number of homes expected to be planned for (with other methods only being acceptable in exceptional circumstances). This approach would plan to deliver a minimum requirement of 272 homes per year.
Option C: Use the standard methodology as a base figure but pursue a different annual requirement such as a ‘growth’ strategy or seek to help meet any unmet need from other partners within the HMA and beyond. The MDC
plan would seek to deliver a minimum of Mansfield District Council’s own needs plus an agreed unmet need from neighbouring local authorities, this could be incorporated into the plan and secured through a Statement of

over the period 2019/20 to 2028/29, with an annual target of at least 1,335

an assessment of housing sites within the borough, carried out as part of
the London-wide Strategic Housing Land Availability Assessment (SHLAA
2017). The housing trajectory for this ten year period is included in Annex 12,
along with the indicative housing requirement figures for the five designated
neighbourhood planning areas in Lambeth (or the part of those cross-border
areas that fall within Lambeth). The indicative target for years 11-15 of the plan
period is 5,066 net additional dwellings (or 1,013 dpa), based on the 2017
SHLAA findings and by rolling forward the borough’s small housing sites figure
in accordance with paragraph 4.1.12 of the London Plan.

Issue: Setting the right level of housing need.
Government policy requires local authorities to use the Standard Method to calculate how much new housing they will need. The Standard Method uses the expected change in the number of households over time as the starting point and adjusts that figure to take account of how affordable homes are in the borough. The Standard Method calculates that we would need to deliver 141 new homes per year. This would mean a total of 2,961 homes would be required by 2043.

However, Government policy also permits local authorities to set an alternative target if they want to plan for growth. This may include instances where new employment developments would lead to a need for more housing, for instance. The current adopted plan identified a need that was not able to be met within Tamworth, and that unmet need is being delivered through the local plans of Lichfield and North Warwickshire. On that basis, we propose to use the standard method figure of 2,961 as the starting point for this plan. However, to make sure the number is considered up to date when the plan reaches examination, it will need to be updated later in the process.","","2024-01-18 14:52:09.891616","2025-05-22 01:03:19.160334","","","","",""

We consider that this revisits the housing requirement because there is an increase in the housing requirement set out in the adopted development plan; i.e. they haven’t simply just factored completions since adoption of the previous plan, but through duty to cooperate clarified the quantum of unmet need to be met and increased the housing requirement accordingly [Part 2 plan adopted 9 October 2019].
