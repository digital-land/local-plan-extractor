# Local Plan Extractor

Extract information from local planning authority websites and local plan documents to seed data for https://planning.data.gov.uk 

The data extracted is in the format defined by the following data specifications:

* [Local plan](https://digital-land.github.io/specification/specification/local-plan/) &mdash; headline information including housing numbers currently found in code local plan documents 
* [Local plan timetable](https://digital-land.github.io/specification/specification/local-plan-timetable/) &mdash; estimated and actual dates for milestones, currently found in [Local Development Scheme](https://digital-land.github.io/specification/specification/local-plan/) documents 

Local planning authorities are encouraged to review and improve this data using using the [Check and Provide](https://provide.planning.data.gov.uk) service.

# Set-up

Requires Python 3.12 or newer, and Make v4.0 or above.

    $ make init

The build needs an [ANTHROPIC_API_KEY](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/get-started) for Claude:

    $ export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY='your-key-here'
